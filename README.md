# FollowerFactory
Create the scatterplots used in [NYTimes' Follower Factory](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/01/27/technology/social-media-bots.html).

### Getting Started
Install dependencies.
```
pip install TwitterAPI # or pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Edit `ff.py` for your account. Go to https://apps.twitter.com/ to get your API keys.
Don't forget to fill in your screen name (or someone else's).

```
CONSUMER_KEY = ''
CONSUMER_SECRET = ''
ACCESS_TOKEN = ''
ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET = ''

SCREEN_NAME = 'eiaine'
```

Run!
```
python ff.py
```

This can take a long time due to Twitter's rate-limiting, so expect to wait about an hour for every 12,000 followers. When the script is complete, view the results by opening `index.html` in your web browser. Your plot will look something like this:

### Troubleshooting
If the chart fails to load, you may be getting an error along the lines of `Cross origin requests are only supported for protocol schemes: http, data, chrome, chrome-extension, https`. To fix this, either open `index.html` in firefox, or start chrome with `--allow-file-access-from-files`, or try some of the other suggestions listed [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10752055/cross-origin-requests-are-only-supported-for-http-error-when-loading-a-local).

Another way to avoid the Cross origin error is to run ```python -m SimpleHTTPServer``` and navigate to http://localhost:8000.
